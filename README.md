# cars

This bash script, the user is allowed to add a car to a list and look at the list of cars that they have added.

For example, the original list of cars is:
* 1948:Ford:sedan 
* 1952:Chevrolet:coupe
* 1960:Ford:Mustang 
* 1972:Chevrolet:Corvette
* 1977:Plymouth:Roadrunner

If the user adds in a 1999 Jeep Wrangler, the new list displayed to them would be:
* 1948:Ford:sedan 
* 1952:Chevrolet:coupe
* 1960:Ford:Mustang 
* 1972:Chevrolet:Corvette
* 1977:Plymouth:Roadrunner
* 1999 Jeep Wrangler (there are spaces here instead of colons due to the extra credit portion)

The list will appear to the user in sorted order from the year and the user has the option to quit anytime.
